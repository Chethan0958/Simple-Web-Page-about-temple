            <p2>Udupi Shri Krishna Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Krishna and Dvaita Matha located in the city of Udupi in Karnataka, India.
        The Matha area resembles a living Aashram, a holy place for daily devotion and living. Surrounding the Shri Krishna Temple are several temples namely the Udupi Anantheshwara Temple which is over a thousand years old.</p2>

        <p4>Shri Anantheswara temple is the most ancient temple of Udupi. It is interesting to note that this village derived the name, Shivalli from this temple. The Brahmins who settled around this place came to be identified as Shivalli Brahmins.
            Some scholars are of the opinion that the original form of Shivalli was Shiva Halli. In the books written in the distant past it was also referred to as Shiva Belli which was transformed into Roupya Peeta or Rajatha Peeta in Sanskrit. Thus Udupi owes its name Rajatha Peetapura to this temple.</p4>

        <p6>Adjacent to Shri Ananrheshwara temple, the devotees can see the temple of Shri Chandramouleeswhara in the east. Even though it is an ancient temple historic details are not forthcoming.
            One of the legends woven round this temple holds that there was a clump of trees called Abjaranya (the present Poornaprajna College campus) that existed at a distance of half a k.m. from the heart of Udupi town. There was a small lake nearby. A belief is doing the rounds that the Moon god performed penance in this spot. That is why the place came to be called Abjaranya. Immensely pleased with the Moon godâ€™s penance, Lord Shiva appeared before him and granted his wish. Chandramouleeshwara temple surfaced in order to commemorate this event.
            Chandramouleeswhara temple is small in size when compared to the neighbouring Anantheshwara temple. The literary work Madhwa Vijaya tells us that the temple used to be called Moodu Devalaya (Mahendradigalaya) as it lies to the east (moodu) of Shri Anantheshwara temple which is considered as the chief temple of the place.</p6>
